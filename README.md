# The Monster of the Mansion

Welcome to our CS 415 final project! In this, you play as a man trying to escape from a mansion. You progress from the top floor to the bottom, and as you go through the levels, you learn the secrets and history of the mansion and the monster chasing you.

WASD to move. Tab to use wards, which freeze the monster briefly. Books are scattered about the stages for you to read. Have fun!
